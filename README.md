# Event-Registration-Attendee-Management
Event Registration &amp; Attendee Management is a Salesforce-based solution designed to simplify event organization for institutions and businesses. This project enables organizers to create and manage event listings, register attendees, automate confirmation/reminder emails, and track attendance and engagement through dashboards and reports.

# Event Management System

## Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis
The core problem is that many organizations struggle to manage event registrations efficiently, leading to lost data, poor communication, and low attendee engagement. Most educational institutions, clubs, and businesses require a centralized system to handle registrations, automate notifications, and improve attendee experience.

## Requirement Gathering
Events must be created, scheduled, updated, and cancelled.

Attendees need to register for events with personal details (name, email, contact, etc.).

Organizers require automation for confirmation and reminders.

Attendance tracking and reports are necessary for insights.

Simple user interface for both admin and participants.

## Stakeholder Analysis
Event Organizers: Manage events, track registrations, analyze reports.

Attendees/Participants: Register for events, receive notifications, view schedules.

Admins: Oversee processes, manage users, troubleshoot issues.

## Business Process Mapping
Event creation → Registration opens → Attendee registers → Confirmation sent → Reminders sent → Event occurs → Attendance recorded → Feedback/metrics tracked.

Possible exceptions: Event rescheduling/cancellation, attendee unregistration.
